==> Caveats
wineskin is built for Intel macOS and so requires Rosetta 2 to be installed.
You can install Rosetta 2 with:
  softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
Note that it is very difficult to remove Rosetta 2 once it is installed.

==> Installing Cask wineskin
Warning: macOS's Gatekeeper has been disabled for this Cask
==> Moving App 'Wineskin Winery.app' to '/Applications/Wineskin Winery.app'
